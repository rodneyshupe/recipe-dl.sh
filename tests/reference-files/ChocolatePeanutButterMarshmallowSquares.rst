A classic no-bake dessert taken to the next level, with marshmallow
krispies on the bottom, milk chocolate peanut butter in the middle, and a
bittersweet chocolate on top.

Ingredients
-----------

- 8 tbsp butter (divided)
- 3 cups mini marshmallows
- 4 cups puffed rice cereal
- 4 oz milk chocolate
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 3 oz bittersweet chocolate (about a 1/2 cup, measured)

Directions
----------

1. In a wide saucepan or skillet, melt 4 tablespoons butter over low
   heat. Add the mini marshmallows, and stir for about 5 minutes, until
   the marshmallows have completely melted. Stir in the puffed rice
   cereal, and stir to coat.
2. Scrape the marshmallow cereal out into an 8x8 square pan, and press it
   down with a spatula to really compact the marshmallow squares. Let
   that cool while you start on the peanut butter chocolate layer.
3. Melt the milk chocolate and peanut butter in a double boiler or in the
   microwave in 30-second intervals, then spread the mixture evenly over
   the top of the marshmallow cereal. Refrigerate for about 2 hours until
   firm to the touch.
4. For the final layer, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and
   the bittersweet chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave.
   Spread the mixture over the milk chocolate peanut butter layer, and
   refrigerate for another half hour or so, until firm to the touch. Cut
   into squares and enjoy!
