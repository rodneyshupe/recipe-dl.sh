I like the glaze that comes from baking these wings at a nice high
temperature. As the cooking liquid from the chicken reduces with the
sugars in the honey and the umami in the soy sauce, it coats the wings
in a burnt, sweet and succulent glaze. This makes an intentionally
large quantity for six people, as leftovers are mandatory and always
appreciated.

Ingredients
-----------

- 5 pounds chicken wings
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- Kosher salt
- Lime wedges, for serving
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 1/2 shallot, cut into julienne
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- Kosher salt

Directions
----------

1. For the chicken wings: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Allow the wings to come to room temperature for 15 minutes. Line
   a sheet tray with foil.
3. Toss the wings in the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar, honey and a
   healthy pinch of salt in a large bowl. Pour the wings onto your
   prepared sheet tray and arrange them in a single layer (use 2 sheet
   trays if necessary). Bake the wings for 30 minutes, then remove
   them from the oven and carefully flip over.
4. Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F and cook the wings
   until golden brown, the meat is falling off the bone and the glaze
   has reduced to a syrup, about 30 minutes more. Allow to cool for
   10 minutes.
5. For the yogurt sauce: Meanwhile, mix the yogurt, shallots, parsley,
   lemon juice and some salt in a small bowl with a rubber spatula
   and set aside.
6. After the wings have cooled, toss them with the yogurt sauce in a
   large bowl. Serve with lime wedges.
