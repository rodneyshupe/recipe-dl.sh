This Instant Pot split pea soup tastes like it’s been cooking with
a juicy ham hock for hours, but comes together in 12 minutes under
pressure. Don’t forget those bacon croutons.

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 leeks, white and pale green parts only, halved, thinly sliced crosswise
- 1 medium onion, halved, thinly sliced
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 2 smoked ham hocks
- 1 lemon
- 1 tsp. ground cumin
- ½ tsp. cayenne pepper
- ½ tsp. ground turmeric
- 16 oz. green split peas, picked over
- 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- 4 oz. slab bacon, cut into ½"-thick strips
- 6 oz. day-old white or sourdough bread, cut into ½" pieces (about 4 cups)
- ½ tsp. mild red pepper flakes, plus more for serving
- Kosher salt
- Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges
- An Instant Pot or other electric multicooker or pressure cooker

Directions
----------

1. Soup: Set Instant Pot to “Sauté” on medium heat. Pour in oil,
   then add leeks and onion and stir to coat. Season generously with
   salt and black pepper. Set lid askew over pot (depending on the make
   and model of your pressure cooker, you can set the lid off-center
   or close it down part way) and cook, stirring every few minutes,
   until leeks are bright green and vegetables are softened but still
   juicy-looking and not browned, 8–10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, make 2 or 3 vertical cuts into outer band of skin on ham
   hocks (this will help the fat cook out and the meat tenderize under
   pressure). Cut lemon in half and squeeze juice into a small bowl.
3. Add cumin, cayenne, and turmeric to leek mixture and stir to
   combine. Cook, stirring, until spices are very fragrant, about 1
   minute. Nestle ham hocks into vegetables so that cut sides make
   contact with cooking surface. Cook undisturbed until fat starts
   to cook out, about 3 minutes. Add split peas and stir to coat;
   season with salt. Stir in 6 cups water. Lock lid and set machine
   to cook at high pressure 12 minutes (allow 20 minutes or so for
   it to come to pressure). Manually release pressure. Transfer ham
   hocks to a cutting board and let cool slightly.
4. Pick meaty pieces off ham hocks and cut into small pieces, then stir
   ham back into soup. Taste and season soup with salt, black pepper,
   and lemon juice.
5. Bacon Croutons and Assembly: While soup is cooking, melt butter
   in a large skillet over medium heat until foaming. Add bacon and
   cook, stirring, until bacon has released about half its fat and is
   starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add bread pieces and toss well
   to coat. Cook, tossing occasionally, until croutons are golden brown
   and starting to crisp and bacon is chewy-crisp, about 5 minutes. Mix
   in ½ tsp. red pepper flakes; season with salt.
6. Divide soup among bowls. Top with bacon croutons and a drizzle of
   oil; season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Serve
   with lemon wedges for squeezing over.
7. Do Ahead: Soup (without toppings) can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool,
   then cover and chill. Reheat gently, stirring and adding water to
   loosen if needed.
