This is a creamy, cheesy, classic mac &amp;#39;n&amp;#39; cheese! The
macaroni cooks in vegetable or chicken broth, and there&amp;#39;s no
straining or draining required. For a change of pace, switch out the
cheddar cheese for Fontina, Gruyère, or smoked Gouda.

## Ingredients

* 1 pound elbow macaroni 
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth  
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
* 12 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (3 cups tightly packed) 
* 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces)  
* 1/2 cup sour cream  
* 11/2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard  
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 

## Directions

1. Combine the macaroni, broth, and butter in the Instant Pot. Secure
   the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Select the Manual
   setting and set the cooking time for 6 minutes at high pressure. 
2. Perform a quick release by moving the Pressure Release to
   Venting. Open the pot and stir in the cheeses, sour cream, mustard,
   and cayenne pepper. Let sit for 5 minutes to thicken, then stir
   again and serve.
