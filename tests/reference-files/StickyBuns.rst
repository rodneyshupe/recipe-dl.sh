Sticky buns look inviting, but most are dry and overly sweet, with
a topping that threatens your dental work. We wanted a version that
fulfilled its promise.

Ingredients
-----------

Flour Paste
^^^^^^^^^^^

- 2/3 cup water
- 1/4 cup (1 1/3 ounces) bread flour

Dough
^^^^^

- 2/3 cup milk
- 1 large egg plus 1 large yolk
- 2 3/4 cups (15 1/8 ounces) bread flour
- 2 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

Topping
^^^^^^^

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 cup packed (3 1/2 ounces) dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup dark corn syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 cup pecans, toasted and chopped (optional)

Filling
^^^^^^^

- 3/4 cup packed (5 1/4 ounces) dark brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions
----------

1. FOR THE FLOUR PASTE: Whisk water and  flour together in small
   bowl until no lumps remain.  Microwave, whisking every 25 seconds,
   until mixture  thickens to stiff, smooth, pudding-like consistency
   that forms mound when dropped from end of whisk  into bowl, 50 to
   75 seconds.
2. FOR THE DOUGH: In bowl of stand mixer,  whisk flour paste and
   milk together until smooth.  Add egg and yolk and whisk until
   incorporated. Add  flour and yeast. Fit stand mixer with dough
   hook and  mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, 1 to 2
   minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes. Add sugar and salt  and mix on
   medium-low speed for 5 minutes. Stop  mixer and add butter. Continue
   to mix on medium-low  speed for 5 minutes longer, scraping down
   dough  hook and sides of bowl halfway through (dough will  stick
   to bottom of bowl).
3. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter.  Knead briefly to form
   ball and transfer seam side  down to lightly greased bowl; lightly
   coat surface  of dough with vegetable oil spray and cover bowl
   with plastic wrap. Let dough rise until just doubled  in volume,
   40 minutes to 1 hour.
4. FOR THE TOPPING: While dough rises,  grease 13 by 9-inch metal
   baking pan. Whisk melted  butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar,
   corn syrup,  and salt together in medium bowl until smooth. Add
   water and whisk until incorporated. Pour mixture  into prepared pan
   and tilt pan to cover bottom.  Sprinkle evenly with pecans, if using.
5. FOR THE FILLING: Combine sugar and  cinnamon in small bowl and mix
   until thoroughly  combined; set aside.
6. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter.  Press dough gently
   but firmly to expel air. Working  from center toward edge, pat
   and stretch dough to  form 18 by 15-inch rectangle with long edge
   nearest  you. Sprinkle filling over dough, leaving 1-inch  border
   along top edge; smooth filling into even  layer with your hand,
   then gently press mixture into  dough to adhere.
7. Beginning with long edge nearest you, roll  dough into cylinder,
   taking care not to roll too tightly.  Pinch seam to seal and roll
   cylinder seam side down.  Mark gently with knife to create 12 equal
   portions. To  slice, hold strand of dental floss taut and slide
   underneath  cylinder, stopping at first mark. Cross ends of  floss
   over each other and pull. Slice cylinder into 12  portions and
   transfer, cut sides down, to prepared  baking pan. Cover tightly
   with plastic wrap and let  rise until buns are puffy and touching
   one another,  40 minutes to 1 hour. (Buns may be refrigerated
   immediately after shaping for up to 14 hours. To  bake, remove
   baking pan from refrigerator and let sit  until buns are puffy and
   touching one another, 1 to  1 1/2 hours.) Meanwhile, adjust oven
   racks to lowest  and lower-middle positions. Place rimmed baking
   sheet on lower rack to catch any drips and heat oven  to 375 degrees.
8. Bake buns on upper rack until golden brown,  about 20 minutes. Tent
   with aluminum foil and bake  until center of dough registers at
   least 200 degrees,  10 to 15 minutes longer. Let buns cool in pan on
   wire rack for 5 minutes. Place rimmed baking sheet  over buns and
   carefully invert. Remove pan and let  buns cool for 5 minutes. Using
   spoon, scoop any  glaze on baking sheet onto buns. Let cool for at
   least  10 minutes longer before serving.

Notes
-----

* These buns take about 4 hours to make from start to finish. For
  dough that is easy to work with and produces light, fluffy buns,
  we strongly recommend that you measure the flour for the dough
  by weight. The slight tackiness of the dough aids in flattening
  and stretching it in step 6, so resist the urge to use a lot of
  dusting flour. Rolling the dough cylinder tightly in step 7 will
  result in misshapen rolls; keep the cylinder a bit slack. Bake
  these buns in a metal, not glass or ceramic, baking pan. We like
  dark corn syrup and pecans here, but light corn syrup may be used,
  and the nuts may be omitted, if desired.
